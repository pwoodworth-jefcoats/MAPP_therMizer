# MAPP_therMizer
This repository is home to the code used to run therMizer simulations
for a UH-NOAA MAPP collaboration.  It's currently being built out, so
if you don't see a file that's mentioned know that it'll be available
soon.  I'll remove this message once the basic construction is 
complete.

## Climate Forcing
therMizer is forced by both temperature and plankton data. These data
come from members of the CESM2 earth system model large ensemble (LENS).  `MAPP_forcing_visualization.Rmd` was used to visualize some of the LENS 
data that was used to force therMizer.

### Temperature data
Temperature was vertically averaged over depth ranges representative of 
species' vertical habitat use.  It was then horizontally averaged over the
model domain. 

Temperatures from the World Ocean Atlas were used as a baseline to which
the LENS-projected change in temperature were applied.  Change was 
measured as the difference between 2015 and the years 2016 - 2100.

Further details about processing the temperature data can be found in
`Workflow_Temperature.Rmd`.

### Plankton data
Plankton carbon was vertically integrated over the upper 150 m of the water
column and then summed over the model domain.  This was done for small 
phytoplankton, diatoms, diazotrophs, and zooplankton, individually.  Within
each class of plankton, total carbon was converted to numerical abundance and
used to calculate a resource spectra which sets the prey available at each
time step in the therMizer simulation.

Further details about processing the plankton data can be found in
`Workflow_Plankton.Rmd`.

## Fishing Forcing
A static fishing simulation is used to assess the effects of climate variability 
and change.  Several dynamic fishing simulations are run to assess the potential 
effects of changing fishing mortality.

Further details about preparing these simulation forcings can be found in
`Workflow_Fishing.Rmd`.

## therMizer Simulations
`MAPP_run_therMizer_Baseline.Rmd` was used to run baseline therMizer simulations.  Ten baseline simulations were run, one each with input from each LENS ensemble member, all with fishing mortality set a 0.2.  `MAPP_baseline_results.Rmd` was used to visualize simulation results.

Further information, including all code, for the [mizer](https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/) food web model and 
the [therMizer](https://github.com/sizespectrum/therMizer) model extension is available online.
